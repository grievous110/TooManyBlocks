## TooManyBlocks
Cloning Note:
This project uses submodules so you need to use the --recurse-submodules flag to initialize those on clone.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/grievous110/TooManyBlocks.git
```

Additionally the glew library needs to generate its source files to be usable in the build process. Use make for in mingw32-make for that.
